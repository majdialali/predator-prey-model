# predator-prey-model
a group project on master level where we develop a simulation model consisting of rabbits (predator) and a mixture of nutritious and toxic flowers (prey), which uses these techniques to explore how different agent-traits evolve during each iteration of the model. Our simulation shows that the rabbits are capable of adapting to their environment by improving their intelligence, which is represented by an Artificial Neural Network trained with reinforcement learning and optimized by genetic algorithm..


How to run the project:

Have Python version 3.9 or 3.10 installed with the required modules found in Requirements.txt (can be installed with "pip install requirements.txt" in a CLI).

Make sure all files (main.py, nn_toolbox.py and pycxsimulator.py) are located in the same folder.

Double click on the main.py file or find it through a CLI and run with the python keyword: python main.py.

The code will stop running when predators/rabbits are extinct.
